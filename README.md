# css-art
ðŸŽ¨ A small repository of my CSS-based art.

Each sub-directory contains one artwork, along with an associated README.md file which describes and showcases it. In some cases, interactive demos are linked.

My educational and creative process with CSS art has been described in an article on my personal blog, [Short adventures in CSS art](https://tadeasjun.com/blog/css-art).
